# HackFS Goals:
- Simple Docs: README / one-pager, "what is this?", "why?", "how?", "How to get started?"
- Super catchy branding.
- E2E Rinkeby/Mainnet Example Demos (Simple Storage, UniswapV2, etc)
- WASM Interface: API Ref doc for others to look at and comment on
- - ethereum, subgraph, ipfs
- CLI: Build, Publish
- Tests: CLI, JS Client, WASM Runtime
- Landing Page (Webflow?)
- - High level description (what? why? who? how?)
- - Links: docs, github
- - Web3Hub Intro (mockups)
- - Support / Invest: DAO Fund?
- DAO Setup W/ 15k & open to outside partner/funder proposals

# Open Questions
- Branding: does "Web3API" communicate the right thing?
- - What do we want to communicate first:
- - - universal APIs in any language?
- - - easy as web2 for users?
- - - symantic web3?
- - - dyanamic dapps?
- - - etc
- - ThreePort, 3Port, Port3, Sem3, SemNet
- - Semantics, Portable, Universal, Ontology
- - dAPI, dAPIHub 
- - Greek God? Philospher?

# Main Vision
- Portable/Universal dApp SDKs (Portable SDK)
- Unified Schema For Protocols (Semantics, Web3API)
+ + Composable Protocols
+ + Extendable Protocols
+ + Governable Protocols
- Discover Protocols (Hub)
+ + Interact W/ Any Protocol
- dApp Engine (dEngine)
