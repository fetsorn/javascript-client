ðŸš¨ **Web3API is in Pre-Alpha** ðŸš¨  

## **Web3's Universal Integration Standard**  
[Web3API](https://web3api.dev) makes integrating Web3 protocols into applications seamless, without sacrificing decentralization. Interact with any blockchain, from any programming language, in seconds.  

## How?  
> For the visual learners, here is a [video](http://video.web3api.eth.link/).  

Web3API accomplishes this through a WebAssembly (WASM) standard and a developer toolchain that streamlines Web3 protocol integrations. All logic that was once bundled into JavaScript SDKs (among other languages) is now within lightweight, secure, and portable WASM modules called Web3APIs.

See the specification for [more information](https://github.com/Web3-API/specification/blob/main/spec/intro/1_Introduction.md).
