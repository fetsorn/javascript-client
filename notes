Schema Pipeline:
1. Composition:
  - import all local schemas
  - import all external schemas
  - add any GraphQL type headers to the schema so it'll build

  * Make sure error handling is prop, because this isn't being handled right now
    * file not found for local import
    * duplicate namespace name for different URIs
    * Type not found in the file that's being imported
    * file not found for external import
    * duplicate types that may conflict
    * make sure you can't import a mutation inside of a query schema
    * nested dependencies work (Cat_Animal_Breed) where Animal_Breed is inside of cat.graphql, and Breed came from "animal.eth"

2. Parse
  - Parse the valid schema into a TypeInfo struct
3. Bind
  - Take the schema's TypeInfo, and generate binding code
