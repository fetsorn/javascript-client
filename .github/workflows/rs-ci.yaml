# NOTE: Mac & Windows CI is not currently possible, since GitHub Actions does not
# use "Docker Enterprise". Docker Enterprise is required when running linux based
# containers, which is what we run within our toolchain for test-envs and build-envs.
# In order to enable this, we can move to Circle CI, which supports Docker Enterprise.
