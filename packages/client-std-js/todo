TODO:
remove the (client-js <> client-js-plugins) circular dependency by allowing the plugins to build
directly from the core. client-js will consume the core + the required client-js-plugins

TODO:
make GraphQL in & out happen within the client. All internals should use module + method + args
(including WASM code). This will reduce the amount of parsing needed when calling between modules.
The arguments don't matter because null arguments are handled by decerialization logic.
