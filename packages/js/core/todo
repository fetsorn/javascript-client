TODO:
make GraphQL in & out happen within the client. All internals should use module + method + args
(including WASM code). This will reduce the amount of parsing needed when calling between modules.
The arguments don't matter because null arguments are handled by decerialization logic.

TODO:
better define how query args + result are passed through (query args, invoke args, invoke result, query result)

Query Args (GraphQL compliant)
x can have many queries in a single document

x Invoke Args
- single invocation

x Invoke Result
- single data + errors

Query Result (GraphQL compliant)
x namespaced data (query name) + errors array

TODO:
refine how URIs are defined, make w3:// the scheme, and ipfs/ | ens/ the authority
