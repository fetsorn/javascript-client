# TODO
- update template project
- remove "resetDir" from the project classes, should not modify files
- CLI e2e tests should replicate an example developer's project, instead of only diffing the codegen.
- comment everything :P
- make sure the no-config + no-env cases work as expected, and you don't have to pass in "{}"
- cleanup
- add more tests for plugins

# Tests
- plugin shared env
- plugin different module envs
- plugin env sanitization
