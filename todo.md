# TODO
x CLI e2e tests should replicate an example developer's project, instead of only diffing the codegen.
x make sure the no-config + no-env cases work as expected, and you don't have to pass in "{}"
x update template project
x remove "resetDir" from the project classes, should not modify files
x fix multiple images being created for rebuilding the same wrapper
