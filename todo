- one "isPromise" function
- Asyncify.ts: constructor + init function? why is this needed / desired?
- Asyncify.ts: this._config.exports: WeakMap ? why is this a good idea?
- Asyncify.ts: Proxy get?
- AsyncifyWasmInstance.ts: each import is wrapped? Does this mean each one will result in rewinding?
