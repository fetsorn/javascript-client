x default meta manifest doesn't make sense
x make sure meta format is correct
x make sure root format is a new version
x make sure meta files get copied into the output build folder
x add tests for web3api.meta.yaml
- fix typings in core/types/Client.ts
- make sure getFile / getManifest works w/ garbage collection
- is the plugin manifest necessary? correct? should we use it for importing schemas?
- automatically associate "meta" with "web3api.meta.yaml" and "Web3ApiManifest
- - no hard-coding for new formats
- logger plugin has a method overriding the interface method... should this be allowed for adding optional params?
- - either way, we need to detect this, and not output duplicate methods into the output TypeInfo & GraphQL schema
