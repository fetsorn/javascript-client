**We know documentation can be a bit overwhelming sometimes, especially when the subject matter is unfamiliar. Let's make sure you know where to go next!**

If you have questions or want to get involved, feel free to join our Discord server where the Web3API community is actively growing. Feel free to ask questions there, or open an issue in the GitHub repo if you have ideas on how the project can be improved!**
