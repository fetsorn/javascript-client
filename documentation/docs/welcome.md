**Web3API** is a developer toolchain that makes it easy to interact with any blockchain (or P2P network) from any programming language!
<br/>

> _**⚠️ Heads up!** <br/> <br/>
> Web3API is in pre-alpha, meaning our code and documentation are rapidly changing. Have questions or want to get involved? Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Z5m88a5qWu) or [open an issue](https://github.com/Web3-API/monorepo/issues) on our GitHub repo._

### **Getting started**

We know software docs can be overwhelming, especially for something as technical as a developer toolchain. That's why we've made this guide user-friendly for anyone interested in Web3API, whether you're a non-techie or an experienced programmer.

### **For: the casually interested reader**

If you're interested in understanding Web3API at a high-level, we recommend watching [this introductory video on our website](https://web3api.dev). No deep technical knowledge required.

If after that you're still wanting more, checkout this deeper dive from our [ETH Denver presentation](https://youtu.be/9HhB4XL4AR4). This presentation not only cover the tech, but also the ecosystem that's helping make Web3API a reality!

If you'd like to see Web3API in action, checkout our [SimpleStorage on Ethereum demo](/demos/simplestorage-eth).
